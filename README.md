#KeypadEvents

## What is this?
KeypadEvents is an Arduino library that watches the state of keys on a keypad connected to the Arduino and calls assigned callbacks when the key states change.

## Usage
1. Install the library by cloning it into your Arduino user library directory (`/Users/<name>/Documents/Arduino/libraries/` on OSX)
2. Include the KeypadEvents library:
`#include <KeypadEvents.h>`
3. Create a `KeypadEvents` object, initialize input pins (`init()`), assign handlers, and call `KeypadEvents::readEvents()` each loop:

```c++
KeypadEvents keyevents;

void key_down(char key) {
    Serial.print("Key down:");
    Serial.println(key);
}

void key_up(char key) {
    Serial.print("Key up:");
    Serial.println(key);
}

void key_pressed(char key) {
    Serial.print("Key pressed:");
    Serial.println(key);
}

void setup() {
    keyevents.init();
    keyevents.onKeyDown(key_down);
    keyevents.onKeyUp(key_up);
    keyevents.onKeyPressed(key_pressed);
}

void loop() {
    ...
    keyevents.readEvents();
}
```
